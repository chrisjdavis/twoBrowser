Two
==========

A little app that makes working on responsive designs a bit more fun. Also a place to play around with new stuff for Cocoa, like custom UI and animcations.

Two has been released to the App Store! If you find this code useful, I would appreciate either a purchase of the app, or a positive review, or if you really love Two, both!

Thanks for your support and encouragement, and I hope you find Two useful.
